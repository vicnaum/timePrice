What's this?
Everybody knows what the hourly rate is. Except now let's see how much your free time is worth.

The idea is simple - you have some monthly expenses. And if you spend your time doing nothing - you have this debt growing. And you'll have to pay it in the end of the month.

The more expenses you have - the faster your monthly bill grows.

Even if you're doing nothing - you'll have to pay for your time.
P.S. It even grows while you're sleeping!
