        <p class="flow-text">
          Everybody knows what the hourly rate is. Except now let's see how much your <strong>free time</strong> is worth.
        </p>
        <p class="flow-text">
          The idea is simple - you have some monthly expenses.
          And if you spend your time doing nothing - you have this debt growing. And you'll have to pay it in the end of the month.
        </p>
        <p class="flow-text">
          The more expenses you have - the faster your monthly bill grows.
	<h5>Even if you're doing nothing - you'll have to pay for your time.</h5>
